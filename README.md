# SAPDemo
"RFCDemo" is a program that connects to SAP, retrieves data via RFC (Remote Function Call), and exports the results to a CSV file. "DoSomethingTimerTask" and "PeriodDemo" extend this functionality by scheduling the data retrieval and export process to run automatically at regular time intervals.
